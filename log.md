# 100 Days Of ML Code - Log

### Day 0: July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge and decided what to follow. Will decide for the project afterwards.

### Day 1: July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed learning the Basics of Linear Algebra from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&index=1&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) Youtube channel. Next will start Linear algebra from MIT Courseware.

### Day 2: July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started learning the Basics of Linear Algebra from MITOpenCourseWare just to see if there is anything that is left from the other youtube channel

### Day 3: July 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed learning the Basics of Linear Algebra from MITOpenCourseWare. Started Calculus from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) youtube channel

### Day 4: July 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed calculus. Started Probability from [EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-2)

### Day 5: July 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Nothing as I was not well today

### Day 6: July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Probability from [EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-2)

### Day 7: July 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Probability Unit-1 from [EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-2)

### Day 8: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Using the code from the [Siraj Raval Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg&list=PL2-dafEMk2A6QKz1mrk1uIGfHkC1zZ6UU) built an example to predict the gender using different Algorithms like Logistic Regression, DecisionTreeClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, GaussianNB and SVC. 
Learnt the shortfall of using the same(Complete) dataset for classification and testing from this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pP4EwWJgIU). 
Also tried Comparing Different Algorithms and finding accuracy for the Algorithms on the [Breast Cancer Dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html).  

### Day 9: July 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tried Comparing Different k values for KNN Algorithms and finding accuracy for different k values on the [Breast Cancer Dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html) 
using the Train/Test Model and Cross Validation Model using [this Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dbrR-WymjI). Also compared different algorithms and found accuracy using Cross Validation Model.

### Day 10: July 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learnt And Implemented Decision Tree Classifier And Linear Regression

### Day 11: July 21, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learnt And Implemented KNN Classifier And Logistic Regression

### Day 12: July 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learnt And Implemented Support Vector Machine and Random Forest Classification

### Day 13: July 23, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learn And Implemented Random Forest Regression
