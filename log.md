# 100 Days Of ML Code - Log

### Day 0: July 10, 2018

**Today's Progress**: I have setup all the things I needed to complete this challenge and decided what to follow. Will decide for the project afterwards.

### Day 1: July 11, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed learning the Basics of Linear Algebra from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjBOesZCoqc&index=1&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab) Youtube channel. Next will start Linear algebra from MIT Courseware.

### Day 2: July 12, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started learning the Basics of Linear Algebra from MITOpenCourseWare just to see if there is anything that is left from the other youtube channel

### Day 3: July 13, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed learning the Basics of Linear Algebra from MITOpenCourseWare. Started Calculus from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr) youtube channel

### Day 4: July 14, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed calculus. Started Probability from [EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-2)

### Day 5: July 15, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Nothing as I was not well today

### Day 6: July 16, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continued with Probability from [EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-2)

### Day 7: July 17, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed Probability Unit-1 from [EDX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-probability-science-mitx-6-041x-2)

### Day 8: July 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Using the code from the [Siraj Raval Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5pRlIbr6gg&list=PL2-dafEMk2A6QKz1mrk1uIGfHkC1zZ6UU) built an example to predict the gender using different Algorithms like Logistic Regression, DecisionTreeClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier, LinearDiscriminantAnalysis, GaussianNB and SVC. 
Learnt the shortfall of using the same(Complete) dataset for classification and testing from this [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pP4EwWJgIU). 
Also tried Comparing Different Algorithms and found accuracy for the Algorithms on the [Breast Cancer Dataset](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.datasets.load_breast_cancer.html).
